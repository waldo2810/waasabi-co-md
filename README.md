This is my corner on the internet.

### My stack:

- Vite
- MDX

### Hosting & Deployment:

This is hosted in a virtual private server on **hetzner**. Cheapest plan. At this time is 3.85 eur a month.
I build a **docker** image and push it to **Docker Hub**. then pull that image and build it locally on the server.
I use **Caddy** to serve it through https and so far it's been pretty good.
